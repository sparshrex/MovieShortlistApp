# Movie Browser App

This is a React Native application built with Expo, where users can browse movies using the OMDb API and shortlist their favorite movies. The app features two main screens: a Home screen for browsing and a Shortlisted screen to view selected movies. The app uses **Axios** and **React Query** for data fetching, **Redux Toolkit** for state management, and **React Navigation** for handling navigation with a bottom tab navigator.

## Features

- Browse movies using the OMDb API.
- Search for movies by title.
- Shortlist favorite movies to view them later.
- Two main tabs: "Home" and "Shortlisted".
- Beautiful UI with icons for better user experience.
- State management using **Redux Toolkit**.
- Data fetching with **React Query** and **Axios**.
